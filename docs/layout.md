# Proposed Layout

Most pages will contain a header and/or sidebar containing global navigation buttons, such as home, sign-up/sign-in/profile, search box, etc. Similarly, a footer will always be present, containing links to about, faq, and other pages.

## Pages

### Home

The home page will contain a header and a footer, and a list of new threads. The threads show the title of the post(and possibly a preview of the description) but no replies. Selecting the title navigates to a thread page. Between the header and the main body could contain a number of filters for sorting by date, category, etc.

### Sign-Up

The Sign-Up page is self explanatory, but may not include headers and footers for simplicity. There will be a number of common features, like a back button and a sign-in option.

### Sign-In

The Sign-In page will match the style of the sign-up page. Similarly, there will be a forgot-password option.

### Forgot Password

### Text Search

Searching through the text box is more deliberate and will navigate to its own page, following the aesthetic. An option could clear the search bar, keeping the search term as text underneath (alongside filtering options).

### Thread View

After clicking on a deliberate thread, a thread view will show all the post information. The information can load as the page scrolls, or by using a page number.

### About

Likely located in the footer.

### Personal Profile View

### Public Profile View

### Administrator Profile View
